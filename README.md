# My Data Analyst Portfolio Projects
---
This is a collection of a few of my projects that showcase my skills in data analysis using such tools as:
* Python
* SQL
* Tableau

## Getting Started
---
These instructions will get you a copy of the python and SQL projects up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Note, that the parser and telegram bot projects will require you to have your own ```config``` files to run for obvious reasons. Sharing passwords and tokens on GitHub is bad :)

### Prerequisites
Each directory has a ```requirements``` file where there're listed all the libriaries necessary for running that exact project.  
If you want to copy all projects at once, you will need to install the following packages:
* pandas
* plotly
* pandasql
* selenium
* numpy
* beaulifulsoup
* emoji
* httpx
* json
* requests
* plotly_express
* streamlit
* telethon

You can install these packages using pip: ```pip install pandas pandasql plotly selenium numpy beautifulsoup emoji httpx json requests plotly_express streamlit telethon```
Or using conda if you're that kind of guy: ```conda install pandas pandasql plotly selenium numpy beautifulsoup emoji httpx json requests plotly_express streamlit telethon```

### Running the Projects
To run the project, simply run the code in a python environment. The plots will be displayed inline.
